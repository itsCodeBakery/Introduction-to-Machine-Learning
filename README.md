## 📌 Course Overview

Machine Learning (ML) focuses on the design and development of algorithms that learn from data and improve their performance through experience. It enables computers to learn patterns, optimize decisions, and adapt autonomously without being explicitly programmed for every task.

ML techniques power a wide range of real-world applications, including:

* Object detection and image recognition in computer vision
* Sentiment analysis in natural language processing
* Disease detection and treatment planning in healthcare
* Product recommendation systems in e-commerce
* Game-playing strategies
* Movie recommendation engines
* Speech recognition systems
* Fraud detection and loan approval systems in banking

This course provides a rigorous introduction to both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical applications** of machine learning. Students will explore core algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning, understand their mathematical foundations, and implement them in practice.

Throughout the course, we will study:

* Classification
* Regression
* Clustering
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Regularization
* Optimization techniques

The emphasis will be on understanding the **core principles that unify machine learning algorithms**, rather than only applying them as black-box models.

Assessment will include assignments, quizzes, and examinations designed to test both conceptual understanding and practical skills.
