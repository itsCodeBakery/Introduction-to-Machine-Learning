# 🎓 Machine Learning

### Instructor: Syed Shayan Ali Shah

Welcome to the repository for my **Machine Learning** course. This space is designed to be your primary resource for understanding how machines learn from data, the mathematics behind optimization, and the practical implementation of algorithms.

> **📢 Course Announcement:** I will be updating this repository **lecture by lecture**. Each update will include the relevant slides, code examples, and supplementary notes.

## 📌 Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the core principles of **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning.
* Derive and implement various **Loss Functions** (MSE, MAE, RMSE).
* Optimize models using **Gradient Descent** and other solvers.
* Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics.
* Deploy regression and classification models to solve real-world problems.
